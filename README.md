# MO-DAGAME-Offload
This repository shares an extension of the MO-DAGAME framework (http://caosd.lcc.uma.es/projects/famware/tools.htm) to allow offload operations to external servers in order to increase the execution time from mobile devices.  The MO-DAGAME is a framework based on the JMetal framework with the focus on Dynamic Software Product Lines problems using feature models proposed in the paper:  G. G. Pascual, R. E. Lopez-Herrejon, M. Pinto, L. Fuentes, and A. Egyed, “Applying multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to dynamic software product lines for reconfiguring mobile applications,” Journal of Systems and Software, vol. 103, pp. 392–411, 2015.
