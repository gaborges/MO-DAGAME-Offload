## Usage

In order to use the benchmark app on the mobile device:

- copy the benchmark_offload-debug.apk to an Android smartphone
- click to in the file to install (a message asking if you want to install a nonlicenced application will show up. You must agree to proceed)
- Create a folder in the device sdcard
(e.g. /sdcard/modagame-benchmark/models) and copy the input models in that folder.
- Create a folder to store the results of the benchmark (e.g. /sdcard/modagame-benchmark/output)
- Launch MO-DAGAME Benchmark and configure the path of both folders in the

Settings menu.
-- If you use the offload, you must add the server address and port
- Load the database
- Run the benchmark

-- ** After each run you must copy the output folder to a different directory and create again the output folder. It might be done to avoid trash data.

The following runs were performed on the experiments:
Smartphone A - Algothm NSGA-II - No offload (local execution)
Smartphone A - Algothm PAES - No offload (local execution)

Smartphone A - Algothm NSGA-II - With offload to Cloud (remote execution)
Smartphone A - Algothm PAES - With offload to Cloud (remote execution)

Smartphone A - Algothm NSGA-II - With offload to Cloudlet (remote execution)
Smartphone A - Algothm PAES - With offload to Cloudlet (remote execution)
